# BarrioGreenRoom
Python Project to assist in managing the Green Room for the 2023 Barrio show for the Filipino Intercultural Society at Drexel University. Authored by Jacob Van Dine in 72 hours, the week of Barrio.

Python Version 3.9

Usage: in root directory of this repo, execute:
python main.py 

Things to improve:
-Import the script and generate Scenes programmatically instead of hard coding them like I did. 
-Switch statements were added in Python 3.10 and later, I encourage using them for scenes as well if the previous step is not appealing.
-Presentation of the data, maybe in it's own window or something.
